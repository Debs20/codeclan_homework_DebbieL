```{r}
install.packages("MASS")
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
```



```{r}
items <- read_csv("~/codeclan_work/codeclan_homework_DebbieL/week_06/day_02/20190928-items.csv")

```

1. Load the data, clean_names() and explore it.

```{r}
items

```

solution

```{r}
phones <- clean_names(items)

phones
```


Find the brand with the highest numbers of phones in the dataset.

```{r}

glimpse(items)
  

```

```{r}
items %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  count(brand) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(1)
  

```

solution

```{r}
top_brand <- phones %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  top_n(1)

```


2. For your top brand, plot the distribution of phone ratings as a probability density, overlaying a fitted normal distribution. Do you think the normal distribution provides a good model of these ratings?

solution

```{r}
samsung_ratings <- phones %>%
  filter(brand == "Samsung") 

samsung_ratings

```



```{r}

samsung_stats <- phones %>%
  filter(brand == "Samsung") %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    mean = mean(rating),
    sd = sd(rating)
  )
samsung_stats
```


```{r}
samsung_stats_fitdistr <- MASS::fitdistr(x = samsung_ratings$rating, densfun = "normal")
samsung_stats_fitdistr

```


```{r}
samsung_ratings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), col = "white") +
  stat_function(
    fun = dnorm, 
    args = list(
      mean = samsung_stats$mean,
      sd = samsung_stats$sd
    ),
    col = "red"
  )
```



```{r}
samsung_mean <- items %>% 
                summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating))

samsung_mean
```

```{r}
samsung_sd <- items %>%
              group_by(brand) %>%
              summarise(
              sd = sd(rating))
samsung_sd

```


```{r}

items %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  skim()

```


```{r}
samsung_normal <- tibble(
    z = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 0.01),
  f_z = dnorm(x = z)
)

samsung_normal %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = z, y = f_z)) +
  geom_line()


```

[Hint - you will need to calculate the mean() and sd() of the ratings to plot the appropriate normal. Alternatively, investigate using the fitdistr() function in the MASS package]


We can be more quantitative in comparing the distribution of top brand ratings with a normal distribution. You calculated the mean() and sd() of your distribution in an earlier question. Use these values to calculate the proportions of ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean. Compare these proportions with those you expect for a normal distribution.


```{r}

items %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarise(var = var(rating))

```




You can use a filter() to get only the ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean, and then think about how to calculate what proportion each of these filtered sets make of the total number of ratings. Youâ€™ll need to use three separate filter() and summarise() pipes to do this.

```{r}

samsung_ratings %>%
  filter(rating >= samsung_stats$mean - samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  filter(rating <= samsung_stats$mean + samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  summarise(prop_within_1sd = n() / nrow(samsung_ratings))

```


```{r}

samsung_ratings %>%
  filter(rating >= samsung_stats$mean - 2 * samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  filter(rating <= samsung_stats$mean + 2 * samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  summarise(prop_within_2sd = n() / nrow(samsung_ratings))
```


```{r}
samsung_ratings %>%
  filter(rating >= samsung_stats$mean - 3 * samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  filter(rating <= samsung_stats$mean + 3 * samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  summarise(prop_within_3sd = n() / nrow(samsung_ratings))

```

For a normal distribution, expect 68% of values to fall within one standard deviation of the mean. Here, 79% of ratings are within this range, so our distribution is slightly too central.

Adding another standard deviation to either side should increase the proportion of values by 27% to 95% overall in a normal distribution. Our distribution adds 13%, going to 92% overall, so there are too few values in the range from one- to two standard deviations.

Finally, in a normal distribution, adding a further standard deviation to either side should increase the proportion of values by 4.7% to 99.7% overall. Our distribution adds 6% to 98%, so this is pretty close.


EXTENSION

```{r}
qqnorm(samsung_ratings$rating)
qqline(samsung_ratings$rating)


```

```{r}
install.packages("car")
```


```{r}
library(car)
```


```{r}
qqPlot(samsung_ratings$rating)

```


Here we see significant deviations from straight line in the tails, so the data is not very well approximated as normal.
