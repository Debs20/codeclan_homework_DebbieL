```{r}
install.packages("MASS")
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(skimr)
```



```{r}
items <- read_csv("~/codeclan_work/codeclan_homework_DebbieL/week_06/day_02/20190928-items.csv")

```

1. Load the data, clean_names() and explore it.

```{r}
items

```


Find the brand with the highest numbers of phones in the dataset.

```{r}

glimpse(items)
  

```

```{r}
items %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  count(brand) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(1)
  

```

2. For your top brand, plot the distribution of phone ratings as a probability density, overlaying a fitted normal distribution. Do you think the normal distribution provides a good model of these ratings?


```{r}
samsung_mean <- items %>% 
                summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating))

samsung_mean
```

```{r}
samsung_sd <- items %>%
              group_by(brand) %>%
              summarise(
              sd = sd(rating))
samsung_sd

```


```{r}

items %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  skim()

```


```{r}
samsung_normal <- tibble(
    z = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 0.01),
  f_z = dnorm(x = z)
)

samsung_normal %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = z, y = f_z)) +
  geom_line()


```

[Hint - you will need to calculate the mean() and sd() of the ratings to plot the appropriate normal. Alternatively, investigate using the fitdistr() function in the MASS package]


We can be more quantitative in comparing the distribution of top brand ratings with a normal distribution. You calculated the mean() and sd() of your distribution in an earlier question. Use these values to calculate the proportions of ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean. Compare these proportions with those you expect for a normal distribution.


```{r}

items %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarise(var = var(rating))

```




You can use a filter() to get only the ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean, and then think about how to calculate what proportion each of these filtered sets make of the total number of ratings. Youâ€™ll need to use three separate filter() and summarise() pipes to do this.

```{r}

samsung_ratings %>%
  filter(rating >= samsung_stats$mean - samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  filter(rating <= samsung_stats$mean + samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  summarise(prop_within_1sd = n() / nrow(samsung_ratings))

```
