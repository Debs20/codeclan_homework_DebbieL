In all plots you make, ensure your labels are appropriate. You also must write down a short summary of what each plot tells you in order to meet MVP.

Q1. 

```{r}

library(CodeClanData)
library(ggplot2)

```

```{r}
backpack

```


```{r}
# This gives the dimesnsions and names of this dataset
dim(backpack)
names(backpack)

```

Q2. 
What is the distribution of backpack weights that students are carrying? Choose an appropriate graph to show the distribution.

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = backpack_weight, fill = body_weight), position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer()

```

This graph shows that most students carried between 5 -10 (LBS) in backpack_weight

Q3. Are there differences in backpack weight between sex?

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = backpack_weight, fill = sex)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 7) +
  labs(
    x = " Backpack Weight",
    y = " Count",
    fill= "Sex"
  )
  

```

This graph shows that more females carried 5-10 (lbs) of backpack weight than males, 


q4. What is the relationship between body weight and backpack weight?


```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight), colour = "blue", height = 5, width = 10)

```




Q.5 Is this relationship different between men and women? Choose an appropriate plot and interpret your findings.

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_line(aes(x = body_weight, y = backpack_weight, colour = sex)) 
  

```

The relationship between body weight and back_pack weight shows that in females in the smaller body weight -110-170 carried more bags beiween 10-20 or over. The males were between 150-200 in body weight

Q6. What proportion of students report back pain?

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_col(aes(x = year, y = back_problems), fill = "Light Green")

```

This graph shows that the proportion of year 3 students reported back pain, which means that younger and older students did not have as many problems

Q7 Is this proportion different between men and women?

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_col(aes(x = year, y = back_problems, fill = sex))

```
  
Again this graph shows that year 3 female students had more back problems than males. its also shows that for year 2 and year 6 only females had back problems, so the largest proportion of students with back problems were female

Q8. Now youâ€™ve investigated your data separately, create plots to describe the relationship between backpack weight, body weight, gender and reported backpain. Try both backpack_weight and body_weight as well as the ratio.



```{r}

ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = body_weight, fill = sex), col = "white") +
  facet_grid(back_problems ~ sex)

```
 
This graph shows the females and males that did and didn't have back problems, and their body weight

```{r}

ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = backpack_weight, fill = sex), col = "white") +
  facet_grid(back_problems ~ sex)


```


This graph shows the females and males that did and didn't have back problems, and their backpack weight
